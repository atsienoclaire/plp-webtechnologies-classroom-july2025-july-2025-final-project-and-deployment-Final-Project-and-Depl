# 🌐 Multipage Portfolio Website

## 📖 Project Purpose
This project is a **responsive, multipage website** built with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.  
Its main purpose is to demonstrate the skills I have learned in web development, including:  
- Semantic HTML structure  
- Responsive design using CSS  
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript  
- Organizing a scalable codebase  
- Deploying a live production-ready website  

The site is structured as a **personal portfolio**, where users can learn about me, my services, my work (gallery), and contact me directly.
